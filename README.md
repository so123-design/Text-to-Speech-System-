# Text to Speech System

### Text-to-Speech System Using Deep Learning
This project implements a basic Text-to-Speech (TTS) system, which converts textual input into audio waveforms. It uses a deep learning-based approach to predict mel spectrograms from text sequences. The mel spectrograms are then converted into audio waveforms using a vocoder. This system is a simplified demonstration of TTS pipelines, such as those found in speech synthesis systems like Tacotron.

### Text-to-Speech using gTTS
This project is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built using Python. It reads text from files and converts it to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. The program also has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to play the audio files by clicking buttons.
